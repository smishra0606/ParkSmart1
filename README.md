## 🌟 Overview

**ParkSmart1** is a cutting-edge Smart Parking Management System designed to simplify the process of finding and managing parking spaces. By leveraging [**Mention key technology, e.g., IoT, Computer Vision, or Mobile App**], this system provides real-time data on parking availability, reducing congestion and saving drivers time.

The primary goal of ParkSmart1 is to [**Briefly state the main value proposition, e.g., optimize parking efficiency for users and operators**].

## ✨ Features

* **Real-time Availability:** Display the status (occupied/available) of parking spots in real-time.
* **[Specific Feature 1]:** [e.g., Mobile application for reservation and navigation.]
* **[Specific Feature 2]:** [e.g., Integrated payment gateway for automated billing.]
* **Analytics Dashboard:** A dashboard for parking operators to monitor usage, revenue, and trends.
* **Alert System:** Automated alerts for unauthorized parking or full capacity.
* **[Specific Feature 3]:** [e.g., Hardware integration with ultrasonic sensors or cameras.]

## 🚀 Technologies Used

This project utilizes a modern and robust technology stack:

### Frontend
* [e.g., **React** / **Vue.js** / **Android/iOS (Native or Flutter/React Native)**]
* [e.g., **HTML5** / **CSS3** (with **Tailwind CSS** or **Bootstrap**)]

### Backend
* [e.g., **Node.js** (with **Express**)] / [e.g., **Python** (with **Django** / **Flask**)] / [e.g., **Java** (with **Spring Boot**)]
* **Database:** [e.g., **MongoDB** / **PostgreSQL** / **MySQL**]

### Hardware/IoT (If applicable)
* [e.g., **Raspberry Pi** / **Arduino**]

### 1. Clone the repository

bash
git clone [https://github.com/smishra0606/ParkSmart1.git](https://github.com/smishra0606/ParkSmart1.git)
cd ParkSmart1
2. Configure Environment
Create a file named .env in the root directory and add your configuration variables:

# Example .env content - FILL IN YOUR OWN VALUES
DB_URL=[YOUR_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING]
API_KEY=[YOUR_SERVICE_API_KEY]
